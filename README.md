This is a project submitted as a requirement for this course. [The course](https://www30.tau.ac.il/yedion/syllabus.asp?course=0372402501) was administered in Spring 2020 in [Tel-Aviv University - School of Mathematical Sciences](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/math), and taught by [Dr. Dmitry Batenkov](https://en-exact-sciences.tau.ac.il/profile/dbatenkov). 
This project is a reconstruction of experiments of [[1]](#1) for ??????. A complete documentation of the code is available [here](????)(open it in a web browser).

## Getting Started

The code can be fetched from [this repo](https://github.com/RedCrow9564/InverseProblems-FinalProject.git). The Jupyter Notebook version does the same work, and can be deployed to [Google Colab](?????). While the the notebook version can be used immediately, this code has some prerequisites.
Any questions about this project may be sent by mail to 'eladeatah' at mail.tau.ac.il (replace 'at' by @).

### Prerequisites

This code was developed for Windows10 OS and tested using the following Python 3.7.6 dependencies. These dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
All these packages can be installed using the 'pip' package manager (when the command window is in the main directory where requirements.txt is located):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All the packages, except for Sacred, are available as well using 'conda' package manager.

## Running the Unit-Tests

The Unit-Test files are:

* [test_????.py](UnitTests/test_????.py) - 

Running any of these tests can be performed by:
```
<python_path> -m unittest <test_file_path>
```
